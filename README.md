Dem Stats
=========
What is it?
-----------

Dem Stats is an image statistics generator. It was designed to show my screenshots statistics (live [here](http://r.usr.sh/stats)), but it can be easily adapted to support any kind of image, or file.

Why should I use it?
--------------------

It provides some convenient features, for example EXTREME simplicity (just one file, excluding the JavaScript and CSS ones), a fully responsive layout (works on mobile phones too) and an efficient caching system (caches file names and months/days as necessary).

However, this was strictly designed for my own purposes, so you may need a bit of work if you want to add something.

How do I use it?
----------------

Using Dem Stats is really simple. First, ensure that your HTTPd user has write permissions to the directory where the 'index.php' is located.

Then, configure the `$cfg_*` parameters accordingly. Voila, you're done.

Who wrote this? And what license did you use?
---------------------------

The author is, obviously, [myself](http://r.usr.sh). I used the BSD-2 license. You can find a copy of it in the 'LICENSE' file.
